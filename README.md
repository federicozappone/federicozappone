### Hello there, I'm [Federico Zappone](https://federicozappone.github.io)<br>

I am a computer vision and machine learning engineer.


My main interests are in the aerospace field (mainly lifted and controlled atmospheric entry, autonomous descent and landing, hypersonic parachute design and simulation) and planetary robotics which is what got me interested in computer vision during high school (especially stereo vision and reconstruction).


I consider myself quite capable in the development of autonomous vision based wheeled or aerial robotics systems working in unknown environments.


Even though I'm very far from being an expert (or even remotely fluent for that matter) I enjoy high energy physics and I'm trying to study as much of it as I can in the little free time I have. 


I'm very curious about all things in life, science, and numbers.
